# contacts_manager

An application designed to manage phone contacts

## Getting Started

This project allows the user to create and manage a contacts list.

A 'Contact' is composed by a name [required], a phone number, an email and an image.
A 'Contact' supports CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations, and are saved locally using sqflite.

The contacts list can be sorted alphabetically.
